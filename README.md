# 👩‍💻 About Me

Hi! I'm a Cuban professional with a unique combination of skills that blend information science, technology, creativity, and entrepreneurship.

I hold degrees in both Library Science and Information Technology, and I’ve worked across different fields that reflect my passion for structure, learning, and innovation.

📚 **Librarian by training**, I understand how to organize knowledge and make information accessible.  
🖥️ **Certified IT Technician**, experienced with digital tools and workflows.  
💅 **Entrepreneur**, running my own manicure business with attention to detail and client care.  
📱 **Digital Marketer**, currently managing social media and marketing strategies for several businesses in Suriname.

I enjoy learning new things, helping others grow their ideas, and creating content that connects.  
Let’s build, share, and grow together!
